INSTRUCTION MODULE
So I first created an instruction memory module which takes instructions from 
an instruction.txt file and it outputes an instruction for a particular address

REGISTER MODULE

This module took most time till now as it has 2 parts to it writing back and reading.
For writing back We decoded our WRiteRegister index to a 32 bit array where only at the 
WriteRegisterindex there is a "1".After we got this decoded ouput we saw if our writeenable
is on and if it is then we sent this decoded output into all the registers and where everything turns
out to be one i.e. the decodedoutputbit and writeenable then this register gets overwritten with the 
writebackData.

Now for reading from the register,i first created another array which stores the first bit of all the 
register then the 2nd bit ,then the 3rd bit and so on,and I chose which bit I want from these via again 
decoding the ReadRegister and chosing a specific bit if comparing it with the decoded output there is a 
one.

ALU

Simply said if opcode = 00 then add A + B
            if opcode = 10 then     A - b
            if opcode = 01 then xor A , B

DataMemory 

Same as instruction Memory
