# MIPS PROCESSOR

This is a pipelined mips processor created in Verilog

## Getting Started

Run all the files in terminal as iverilog *.v and see the gtkwave for the results.
Here the output will be shown in terms of waves in gtkwave telling which signal is on and at what state.
In this README.md I have given the instructions for Linux and Windows will put in later.

### Prerequisites

The only prerequisite required is **iverilog** and **gtkwave**.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

1. Download iverilog for the program to run on your computer via the following method. 

```
 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:team-electronics/ppa
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install iverilog
```
2. Then See if you have gtkwave or not and to download it use the following Linux commands
```
 sudo apt-get install gtkwave
```
